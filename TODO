Ideas:
    - Cycle of planting seeds and harvestings
        - Farmland
            - you need to buy a patch of land
            - till the ground 
        - Corn
            - should grown in a few ingame days
            - at the end of every day, there is a chance of a crop to grow
            - seed by throwing seeds on tilled ground   
            - water the crops or they'll die 
        - Sell corn / crops
            - Fill crates to sell those
                - crates are close to a barn/your house
                
    - Goal of the game, create a farming empire.
