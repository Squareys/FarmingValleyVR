Ideas:
    - Cycle of planting seeds and harvestings
        - Farmland
            - you need to buy a patch of land
            - till the ground 
        - Corn
            - should grown in a few ingame days
            - at the end of every day, there is a chance of a crop to grow
            - seed by throwing seeds on tilled ground   
            - water the crops or they'll die 
        - Sell corn / crops
            - Fill crates to sell those
                - crates are close to a barn/your house
                
    - Goal of the game, create a farming empire.

    - Monetize
        - CA Coins
        - Web monitization
        - Wonderleap / zesty.market (https://docs.zesty.market/) ads
    - crop growth:
        ~ At the end of each cycle/day a crop has a chance of growing. If the crop didn't grow, the next
          day the chance is increased. For example, if a plant has a 40% chance of growing, the first day 
          it has 40% chance, the second day this is increased to 80%, the third to 120%=100%. This to make 
          sure a plant grows in a specific amount of time.
